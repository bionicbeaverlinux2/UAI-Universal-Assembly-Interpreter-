# UAI-Universal-Assembly-Interpreter-
Hey there guys. So this is just a project MADE BY BIONICBEAVERLINUX2 (this was just in case one person cloned this git repo and is messed up enough to make it there' s. Trust me there are a lot of people that I know who do this. Anyways hope you use this assembler/editor and hopefully this makes programming in assembly a lot easier.
